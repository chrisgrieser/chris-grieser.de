## Introduction
This is an overview over a comprehensive academic workflow, from getting
annotations into Obsidian to writing a publication with Pandoc citations in
Obsidian as well. There has already been a [detailed description of how to
achieve this with Zotero and
MDnotes](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-zotfile-mdnotes-obsidian-dataview-workflow/15536).

The workflow I describe here deals with very much the same problems, but takes a
different direction. The goal of this post is, however, *not* to provide a
step-by guide for implementing a workflow with certain apps or plugins. Rather,
this post will discuss a general workflow for academic work which can be
implemented with a variety of tools. *Basically, one goal of this post is not to
explain how to use certain tools, but rather to explain what the tasks are you
should be using software tools for.* And, of course, how to structure the
individual tasks in such a way that everything works with minimal friction. The
other goal of this post is to provide *an overview of tools that can be used to
accomplish those tasks*. The overall intention is to give readers the autonomy
to choose their own set of tools to customize their individual workflow.

First, I will outline the Academic Workflow from Reading to Writing in general
and how to how it is implemented in different workflows by the average user and
by the advanced Zotero user. Then, I will briefly outline my implementation and
discuss why I do not use Zotero for it.(Disclaimer: I haven't used Zotero 6.) I
will end with an extensive overview of several tools (apps, plugins) that
together provide comparable features.

## The Academic Workflow from Reading to Writing

### The generalized version
This basic academic workflow looks something like this: You find an article on a
website, and save it in your reference library (i.e., reference manager). The
library entries should be linked to the PDF file of the paper, from which we
want to extract notes to our knowledge base (i.e., Obsidian). Ideally, we want to
keep the link between library entry, knowledge base, and PDF.

Later on, you use your knowledge base to write an article of your own. When
you cite a paper you have read, you basically create a link between the Draft
and the entry in your reference library. During the final compiling of finished
draft, the citations are used to add the bibliography to the finished
manuscript. Ideally, you also use a template to save the time of creating a new
layout every time you write a paper.

![abstract academic workflow](./images/academic-workflow-abstract.webp)

### The simple Word-Zotero version
However, the outlined workflow is not only a very generalized version, but quite
idealized. The "average" researcher, mostly far from being power users, will
often have a much simpler version. Let's imagine such a less tech-savvy
academic, who still uses Microsoft Word. In addition, that person uses a
reference manager (let's say Zotero), and uses the builtin plugin for Word
Citations and the Zotero Browser extension, because those two tools are quite
easy to use and are "officially" provided/advertised by Zotero. In their case,
the workflow from reading to writing should look something like the graph to the
left.

Apart from the lack of a dedicated note-taking system, quotes and information
from PDFs are mostly copy-pasted, and the unorganized notes (e.g. a long list of
bullet points in a separate document ðŸ¥¶) will contain author and year of the
reference. While this is an "implicit" link to the entry in the reference
library, this is far from perfect (e.g., ambiguity when there are two papers by
the same author in the same year).

Another thing to note is that the missing link between the unorganized scrawl
and the PDF makes going back to the context of a quote rather tedious: our
"average" researcher will open up Zotero, search for the respective entry, and
then open the PDF. Also, working on multiple devices gets quite complicated
since Zotero and PDFs may both for themselves sync between devices, but keeping
the link between them is definitely a struggle without further plugins.

Nevertheless, this workflow does accomplish some things well: using the
first-party Zotero tools, articles are easily saved and citations are easily
inserted. The compiling of the final document is particularly easy, since using
the Zotero-Word-workflow enables to export the draft as PDF with just a few
clicks.

![unorganized academic workflow](./images/academic-workflow-unorganized.webp)

### The Zotero-ZotFile-BetterBibTeX-MDNotes-Obsidian-Pandoc version
Now many people here and especially power users dislike Word and would prefer to
write in Markdown. As (on average) technologically more adept users, they want
to automate tedious tasks like copy-pasting quotes. In addition, they use have a
note-taking system like Obsidian. Following the much-mentioned
[Zotero-ZotFile-MDNotes-Workflow](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-zotfile-mdnotes-obsidian-dataview-workflow/15536)
and adding Pandoc, their system is more sophisticated and should look like this.

Compared to the simpler Word-Zotero-Workflow, this has many **advantages**:
- Note Extraction works like a charm when automated via the [MDNotes plugin by
  @argentum](https://github.com/argenos/zotero-mdnotes)
- Files are organized smarter via the [ZotFile Plugin](http://zotfile.com/)
  (e.g. automatic renaming). Also syncing PDFs across machines becomes much
  easier, as you can define separate file storage locations with ZotFile (but to
  keep the Zotero-PDF-Link is yet another story).
- A [reference document](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#option--reference-doc)
  combined with Pandoc saves time layouting.
- The [BetterBibTeX Plugin](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) enables
  the use of [citekeys](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/citing/)
  which are basically unique and unambiguous identifiers that link notes to the
  reference library. Using the [Obsidian Citations
  Plugin](https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin) by Jon Gauthier,
  citations can be inserted into Obsidian during note-taking and writing. (A
  smart renaming pattern is to use citekeys, as the PDFs are linked to the
  reference library entry via its *filename* â€“ it's hard to get more
  future-proof than with filenames.)

However, there are also some **disadvantages**:
- The most common method of using Pandoc is its Command Line Interface ("CLI"),
  which is daunting even to some tech-savvy people.
- Zotero, with a bunch of plugins and with a high number of references becomes a
  bit quite sluggish. (I had 5 plugins with ~3500 references, and Zotero took
  quite a while to start up.)
- BetterBibTeX is the bottleneck for getting citekeys and the `.bib` Library
  file, which you need for Pandoc *and* for the Pandoc Compiling of references
  ([without citekeys and a BibTeX Library, you cannot use Pandoc for
  citations](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations)). Using BetterBibTeX is
  in my view the weak point of this workflow: since the `.bib` file and the
  citekeys are basically an extra layer on top of Zotero, they have to be kept
  in sync. Sync issues are mostly only mildly annoying, but still created the
  need for [yet another plugin to deal with
  them](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-report-customizer).
- The "fragility" of the Zotero workflow should become clear when you look at
  syncing across devices: The Zotero libraries must be kept in sync, but the
  `.bib` libraries BetterBibTeX created by Zotero must be kept in sync as well â€“
  as do they need to stay in sync with the respective Zotero libraries. So to
  keep Zotero and BetterBibTeX libraries in sync, you have to do go deep into
  [obscure hidden plugin settings to set short autopin delays of
  citekeys](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/preferences/hidden-preferences/#autopindelay)
  and also in the worst case even install yet [another plugin to simply deal
  with inconsistent/duplicate
  citekeys](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-report-customizer). Imagine
  working from somewhere with unstable internet connection and having to keep
  *four* libraries in sync. Also, try explaining *autopin delays* to less
  tech-savvy people and watch how they run back to Microsoft Word. You get the
  idea.
- On a meta-level, the workflow also has the drawback that its parts are very
  interdependent, meaning certain components are highly dependent on the others.
  The Zotero plugins obviously require you to use Zotero. On the one hand, this
  means that [they must be developed in sync to
  Zotero](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/722584061087842365/883329564762325032)
  (i.e., you cannot use some plugins for a while with the new Zotero). On the
  other hand, this means that Zotero+Plugins constitutes [an integrated
  ecosystem](https://stratechery.com/2019/integration-and-monopoly/), which are
  known to produce a certain degree of lock-in: you get them only as a package.
  If you want to replace BetterBibTeX, you will have to *also* replace Zotero or
  Pandoc.

*The Zotero-MDNotes-Obsidian Workflow.
(*The graph is unfortunately mirrored, since mermaid.js weighs stuff differently
here.)*

### Decomposing the workflow into subtasks
As I stated before, my solution to several problems is/was to leave Zotero.
Leaving Zotero can be explained by the fact, that for a lot of functionality,
you actually do not use Zotero, but rather the layer on top of it created by its
plugins.

So, by working *directly* with the `.bib` file, you would practically "cut out
the middleman" (Zotero) in this scenario. But as the aforementioned tools form
an integrated ecosystem around Zotero, replacing the weaker parts (BetterBibTeX
and Zotero) means that you must also look for replacements the better parts
(MDNotes, Zotero Browser Extension).

So to approach this challenge, it is basically necessary to decompose the
generalized workflow into *subtasks*, for which you can find individual tools.
The goal would be to find a set of tools that works with little friction, but
also does not lock you into one ecosystem, as any lock-in would leave you with
sub-optimal solution to certain subtasks.

*The BiBTeX Library is the central point of interaction â€“ not Zotero.

The way I see it, the generalized workflow from reading to writing includes the
following subtasks:

1. **Organizing references** â€“ usually solved by a reference management app
2. **Saving references** â€“ a.k.a. *"get the paper from the browser page into the
   reference manager without entering everything manually".*
3. **Linking PDFs, reference entries, and citations** â€“ ideally in the most
   future-proof way
4. **Extracting Annotations/Notes from PDFs** â€“ the effort of copy-pasting only
   facilitates unorganized scrawls instead of organized notes.
5. **Citation Picker for automatic citations** â€“ we really do not want to type
   out everything or switch between reference manager and writing app.
6. **Bibliography Creation** â€“ we want to automatically generate the
   bibliography found at the end of a paper.
7. **Compiling Markdown with Citations** â€“ basically Pandoc with `--citeproc`,
   but we would very much like a simpler solution than a CLI.

## Overview: tools for the individual sub-tasks
Instead of simply presenting my set of plugins/tools, I will rather lay out an
overview of tools for every subtask. The main reasoning behind this, is that I
use the launcher app [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) for the most part, and
Alfred is unfortunately a Mac only app. In addition, I think you everyone would
get far better results when customizing the tool set to their own individual
needs anyway. For those interested, I will conclude this post with a brief
outline of my own workflow.

### 1. Organizing references
Reference managers are the most straightforward part, since basically all
researchers should already be familiar with them. For this reason, I will not
repeat the overviews of reference management apps already done elsewhere, but
focus on **reference managers that work with `.bib` files needed by Pandoc**.
Reason is, that Pandoc is pretty much the only compiling tool we have when we
want to convert Markdown with citations to Word or PDF.

I will also forego the solutions that only *export* to the `.bib` format, since
exports without live-syncing of a library with the BibTeX-File (like
BetterBibTeX does) makes it impossible to use a citation picker's with a `.bib`
that is not reflecting "live" your library (point #4). And if you use use a
citation picker that does not work on `.bib` files (e.g. Zotero's Word Plugin),
you won't be able to use Markdown/Pandoc (point #7). So for a workflow with
automatic citations/bibliography in markdown more or less requires a reference
manager working on BibTeX (or at least one live-syncing to a `.bib` â€“ although
this will have the pitfalls like BetterBibTeX' syncing issues).

Regarding reference managers working on BibTeX files, the field is actually
rather small. To my knowledge there are:

- Name giver [BibTeX](https://tug.org/bibtex/), which is part of most LaTeX
  distributions. It only works from the command line.
- Zotero with the [BetterBibTeX
  Plugin](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/).
- [BibDesk](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/), an Open Source reference manager
  by the makers of PDF Reader [Skim](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io/). Mac
  only.
- [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/), a javascript-based, Open Source reference
  manager that. Available cross-platform. (Zotero users may know JabRef from
  [this page where BetterBibTeX redirects you for Citation Key
  explanations](https://docs.jabref.org/setup/citationkeypatterns).)

Note that both, `BibDesk` and `JabRef` can automatically rename and move PDFs.
This means either of them are basically equivalent to `Zotero + BetterBibTex +
Zotfile`.

### 2. Saving References
There are also tons of other solutions, but again, I will limit the list to the
ones that can be used with the BibTeX format.

- Independent from any individual reference manager, [Bib It
  Now!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bibitnow/bmnfikjlonhkoojjfddnlbinkkapmldg)
  stands out as a feature rich extension for Chrome and chromium-based browsers.
  Generates high-quality BibTeX-Entries which can be copypasted into most
  reference managers (not only the ones mentioned above).
	* Yes, a less known feature of many Reference managers is that you can just
	  copypaste [BibTeX-text](https://www.unf.edu/~wkloster/latex/bib.html)
	  into the reference manager to generate the a proper entry. :)
	* There are numerous other small browser extensions, but the quality of
	  BibTeX-Entries they provide is rather low compared to *Bib It Now!*.
- The [Zotero Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors),
  available for different browsers, but obviously only working with Zotero. Does
  a pretty good job.
- The [JabRef Browser
  Extensions](https://docs.jabref.org/collect/jabref-browser-extension),
  basically the same as the Zotero Connector, but for JabRef. Haven't tested it
  much, but does the job.
- DIY-Solution: Use [DOI Content
  Negotiation](https://citation.crosscite.org/docs.html). It is actually
  surprisingly easy, and the fact that it can run on one line of shell code
  means it is *extremely easy to incorporate in basically any tool that allows
  scripting.* (Alfred Workflow, Keyboard Maestro Macro, etc.).

```bash
curl -sLH "Accept: application/x-bibtex" {{some-doi-url}}
```

### 3. Linking PDFs, Reference Entries, and Citations
The *simple* solution for this is to simply use `author & year` manually. The
*proper* solution to avoid complications (e.g. multiple publications by the same
author in the same year), is to either use  some sort of hyperlink, or to use a
unique identifier like the citekey.

- MDnotes+Zotfile use the Zotero [URI
  Scheme](https://tech-notes.maxmasnick.com/zotero-quickly-get-links-to-library-items-using-zotero-slash-slash-url-scheme-links)
  to deeplink to the PDF *on the respective page*
- Another solution is to use the [file URI
  Scheme](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/File_URI_scheme) `file://` to link to a
  file.
- BibDesk also has its [own URI
  Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibDesk#Citing) which is smartly
  implemented as in the form `x-bdsk://{{citekey}}`, making it so easy to
  automate that I am wondering, why I am the only one who used that ( [in my
  Pandoc Alfred workflow](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/pandoc_alfred)).
- For all intents and purposes, **the very act of using BibTeX already implies
  using citekeys as unique identifiers**. Any citation in a draft or in the
  knowledge base, which uses the citekey, will already have an unambiguous
  "link" to a reference library entry. Using the automatic renaming functions,
  which are offered by basically all reference managers (in case of Zotero with
  ZotFile), you can also prepend citekeys to PDF filenames, ensuring in a very
  future-proof way that you can always associate a citations with a PDF.

### 4. Extracting Annotations/Notes From PDFs
As this step does not require the BibTeX-format, there are far more options
here. The only requirement for the apps and plugins listed below was that they
can export the annotations *as Markdown*.

- [ZotFile](http://zotfile.com/#extract-pdf-annotations) +
  [MDnotes](https://github.com/argenos/zotero-mdnotes), the Zotero Plugins, have
  a lot for formatting options, and can distinguish multiple highlight colors.
- [DocDrop](https://docdrop.org/), a Web Service based on
  [Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/), seems to be still in its infant
  version.
- [PDF Expert](https://pdfexpert.com/), an app from the developer team
  Readdle. It is Mac only, has Markdown Export, and is also a pretty solid and
  popular PDF Reader. It's available for a one-time payment, which does cost a
  bit. However, they offer a 50% educational discount for researchers.
  Unfortunately, like all apps from Readdle, the app has rather poor support for
  automation.
- [Highlights](https://highlightsapp.net/), a PDF reader dedicated to making
  annotations and getting them easily out. The most noteworthy feature should be
  you can annotate images, that are exported with the other annotations.
  Unfortunately, it is Mac/iOS only, and also only available via
  subscription-based payment.
- The Obsidian Plugin [Extract PDF
  Highlights](https://github.com/akaalias/obsidian-extract-pdf-highlights).
  Obviously has great Obsidian integration, but the annotation formatting
  options are rather simple last time I checked.
- [sumnotes](https://www.sumnotes.net/) is a Web service that allows you basic
  annotation extraction. It works on a Freemium model, meaning that you can get
  100 annotation (or something like that) for free, otherwise you have to
  subscribe to their service. Should be useful for doing some quick annotation
  extraction on someone else's devices.
- [Readwise](https://readwise.io/), the well known service for collecting
  highlights from different sources. They offer an official [Obsidian
  Plugin](https://github.com/readwiseio/obsidian-readwise). They are a
  subscription-based service, and also are rather used for eBooks or Kindle
  Book, rather than PDFs.
- [Memex](https://getmemex.com/) and [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is) are
  free annotation extractors, that mostly focus on annotating the web.  [There
  is a step-by-step-guide for Readwise and
  Hypothes.is](https://www.craft.do/s/3wWPrf456Lip8F).
- [Highlighted](https://highlighted.app/), an iOS only App which is used to
  OCR highlights from offline Books (those things printed on paper). It has
  Markdown Export options and you can get some bibliographic informative by
  scanning the ISBN barcode of the book.
- [pdfannots](https://github.com/0xabu/pdfannots), a pyhton-based CLI which
  runs on pdfminer.six as its engine. Its use requires a bit of technical
  knowledge, but it has some useful extraction options like a setting for the
  number of columns per page.
- [PDF Annotation
  Extractor](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/pdf-annotation-extractor-alfred) a
  workflow for the launcher App Alfred. It's basically a GUI for pdfannots with
  many automation and formatting options.  And it has Obsidian integration and
  builtin prepending of a YAML-Header. And I love the fact that it is can merge
  annotations that span across pages and that it is only one-click from the PDF
  to the extracted annotations in Obsidian (Disclaimer: It's developed by me.
  ðŸ˜‰). Drawbacks are that it is unfortunately Mac only, because Alfred is Mac
  only. Furthermore, multi-color highlight are not recognized and (for now) only
  commented highlights and free comments are extracted.
- [Obsidian Annotator](https://github.com/elias-sundqvist/obsidian-annotator),
  an Obsidian Plugin based on [Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/) which
  directly extracts annotations to an associated markdown document. Its features
  include a pretty nifty linking of annotations with specific PDF sections. Its
  major drawback, however, is that you have to *read the PDF in Obsidian itself
  â€” i*t does not work with external PDF Readers.
- [DyAnnotationExtractor](https://github.com/dimi2/DyAnnotationExtractor), a
  JavaScript-based CLI (haven't tested it yet)
- [Skim to MD Notes](https://github.com/achamess/skim_to_md_script) for users of
  the PDF Reader Skim (which tends not to work well with other Annotation
  Extraction Solutions, since it doe snot store annotations in the PDF).
- [Databyss](https://databyss.org/) a academic Word Processor & Note Taking app
  which is also able to extract annotations

### 5. Citation Picker for Automatic Citations
Citation Pickers should be compared based on two criteria 1. *from* which
library format (Zotero, BibTeX/`.bib`, etc.) you can call the picker, and 2.
*into* which app you can insert the citations.

- Zotero has [built-in plugins to insert citations into the three most common
  word processors Word, OpenOffice, and
  GoogleDocs](https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_integration). In
  this case, you use the Zotero library ("from") and have three options
  regarding which app you want to insert the citation *into*.
- When writing in Obsidian, you can use the [Obsidian Citations
  Plugin](https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin) to insert from any
  `.bib` file.
- More established text editors for Programming also have citation picker
  plugins. For example [Citer for Sublime Text
  3](https://github.com/mangecoeur/Citer) or [Autocomplete BibTeX for
  Atom](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-bibtex). (Auto-Complete being a
  "simpler" version of a citation Picker. )
- [Zotpick](https://github.com/davepwsmith/zotpick-applescript) allows to
  insert Markdown citations *into any app*, but unfortunately only works when
  used with Zotero and BetterBibTeX. Only runs on Mac.
- [Zotero Citation Picker for
  Windows](https://github.com/boan-anbo/Zotero-Citation-Picker-for-Windows) is a
  Citation Picker for Zotero that only runs on Windows (duh!). It also relies on
  BetterBibTeX.
- [ZotHero](https://github.com/deanishe/zothero) is an Alfred-Workflow for
  Zotero, which also features citation picking in different citation styles and
  in Pandoc-style.
- [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) has a built-in citation picker, which use
  Zotero or BibTeX formatted libraries, but is only able to insert *into Zettlr
  itself*.
- Using the [Pandoc Suite for Alfred](https://chris-grieser.de/pandoc_alfred)
  (Mac only), you can use get citations from any `.bib` file and input them into
  *any* other app. Also has the most bonus functionality (opening a link
  directly from the picker, emailing full bibliographies of one entry, etc.)
  (disclaimer/proud to say: I am the developer).
- DIY Solution: You can simply use an [internal URL provided by BetterBibTeX
  to trigger a native Zotero Citation
  Picker](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/citing/cayw/#diy) from
  anywhere. As with DOI Content Negotiation, this is a very simple solution,
  which unsurprisingly has been [implemented for some editors like Scrivener,
  vim, or Atom](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/citing/cayw/).

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:23119/better-bibtex/cayw
```

### 6. Bibliography Creation
The options here are fairly limited, since the only method of getting citations
from a markdown document into a compiled Word or PDF file is
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) â€“ the alternative being the Word processor plugins
from reference managers like [Zotero, which requires writing in Word,
OpenOffice, or
GoogleDocs](https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_integration) (which we
didn't want to do in the first place).

However, there are two very noteworthy tools that approach bibliography creation
from a totally different angle, namely the two Pandoc Filters
[url2cite](https://github.com/phiresky/pandoc-url2cite) and
[Manubot-Pandoc-Filter](https://github.com/manubot/manubot#pandoc-filter) (part
of the [Manubot](https://manubot.org/) Project). Instead of saving an article in
the reference library and then using a citation picker to cite them in the
writing app, you directly use an identifier like the DOI or URL with [a
pseudo-pandoc-markdown-syntax](https://github.com/manubot/rootstock/blob/main/USAGE.md#citations)
to insert them *directly* into the draft. The promo screenshot from Manubot to
the right explains the approach probably better than words can.

![Showcase manubot](https://i.imgur.com/eurIfWT.png)

![manubot/url2cite as a shortcut get citations into your
manuscript](https://i.imgur.com/2wDBjcK.png)

Regarding the generalized academic workflow, this direct-identifier-approach
basically works by skipping reference managers entirely, skipping subtask #1
(saving reference), subtask #2 (organizing references), #3 (linking references),
and #5 (citation picking).

However, there is also the drawback that you use reference managers for a
reason: organizing references for later use. When you want to use a reference
two papers later again, a reference manager is still the way to go. Furthermore,
identifiers in itself aren't very useful for disciplines where author identities
matter (mostly social sciences & humanities). Nevertheless, the extreme ease of
use of this approach makes it too tempting to not at least use it for
one-off-citations for which you are *certain* that you will only need them for
one paper.

### 7. Compiling Markdown with Citations (Pandoc)
As mentioned before, there is no way around Pandoc for compiling Markdown
documents with citations. There are, however, multiple methods of actually using
Pandoc, many of which are more user-friendly than using the Terminal.

- Pandoc "Vanilla": The Basic Command line interface. The following syntax is
  the minimum for converting markdown *with citations*. The `csl` file can be
  downloaded from the [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles)
  or directly from [The GitHub
  Repository](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles). (Note that
  using `pdf` as output format requires the installation of a separate [pdf
  engine](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#option--pdf-engine).)

```bash
pandoc "path/to/input.md" -o "path/to/input.docx" --citeproc --bibliography "path/to/library.bib" --csl "path/to/citation_style.csl"
```

- Far easier is the cross-platform menubar app
  [DocDown](https://github.com/lowercasename/docdown), which is essentially a
  graphical interface for [Pandoc](http://pandoc.as/). As Pandoc is packaged
  into DocDown, you even don't need to install Pandoc itself. DocDown requires
  the same inputs as above, but does provide an intuitive graphical user
  interface (GUI) for it. However, the customization options are fairly limited,
  and Pandoc vast capabilities are not really utilized.
- If you are willing to pay, there are also some paid options like
  [Writage](https://www.writage.com/) that make it more convenient to convert
  from Markdown to Word
- The [Obsidian Pandoc
  Plugin](https://github.com/OliverBalfour/obsidian-pandoc) also provides a
  graphical wrapper for Pandoc. However, it only works for markdown notes inside
  Obsidian.
- [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) works quite similarly in having integrated
  Pandoc into the writing app, but has the same drawback of having to open the
  markdown file from inside Zettlr.
- Yet another GUI for Pandoc is the [Pandoc-Suite for
  Alfred](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/pandoc_alfred), which only works on
  Mac (because Alfred is a Mac only app). It comes with a Zotero/BibTeX-Citation
  Picker and automates a lot of stuff, providing a one-click-solution to convert
  a Markdown document from Finder and some other apps, among them Obsidian.
  (Disclaimer: Again, I am the developer.)
- [The Pandoc-Wiki features a very long list
  tools](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/wiki/Pandoc-Extras) for using Pandoc more
  conveniently.

### 8. Bonus: organizing longform writing

Not strictly part of the workflow discussed here, but a much related issue is
the question of how to organize longform writing process itself. The basic approach
("dump everything into one document") is of course unsatisfactory. However,
there are several very different solutions to this:

- The most popular solution is
  [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview), an app
  specifically developed for organizing longform writing. After finishing a
  draft in Scrivener, you can simply export as Markdown and then use Pandoc.
  Unfortunately, Scrivener suffers from the same illness as Microsoft word: [no
  separation of
  concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_content_and_presentation)
  and an unmanageable feature mountain.
- Another quite innovative approach is the outliner-writing-app
  [Gingko](https://gingkoapp.com/) which "let's you write in a tree
  structure". That may sound a bit abstract, but watching the demo videos on the
  website make the idea pretty clear. Gingko's approach is a bit too modular for
  my taste, but I applaud the creativeness of the app and assume that there
  quite a few others for whom the app will work well.
- A recent addition to the Obsidian plugins is the [Longform Plugin for
  Obsidian](https://github.com/kevboh/longform), which offers basic compiling
  and re-arranging functionality that is similar to Scrivener. It is, however,
  still a rather new solution, and some quite essential features like having
  sub-chapters are still missing.
	* When compiling with the Longform plugin, footnotes are not considered
	  (yet), with the result that they are scattered all over the place. You can
	  use the [Linter Plugin](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter) to
	  move all of them to the bottom & also re-index them.
	* Also relevant to people deciding to write Longform in Obsidian might be
	  the [Obsidian Link
	  Converter](https://github.com/ozntel/obsidian-link-converter) for
	  converting Image Links, as Pandoc is not able to parse Obsidian's Image
	  Wikilinks (`![[ ]]`).
	* You can use [this lua
	  filter](https://gist.github.com/maybemkl/d9be15bcabadaa19d2ca50c87b59a92e)
	  to remove wikilinks from a Markdown document during conversion.
	* For across-note-wordcounts, you can use my [Word Count
	  Dashboard](https://gist.github.com/chrisgrieser/ac16a80cdd9e8e0e84606cc24e35ad99#file-word-count-dashboard-md)
	  which uses [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)
	  the plugin.

### My own Implementation of the Workflow
This leaves me to conclude with one last mermaid diagram, depicting my very own
workflow. As all the tools used have been mentioned in the sections before,
little additional explanation should be necessary.
